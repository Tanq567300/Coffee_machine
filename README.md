## Credits
This project is part of my journey through Angela Yu's *100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp*. While the idea originates from the course, the code logic has been written entirely by me and I've even added a refill mode in which the user can restock the coffee machine and redeem the money collected by the coffee by entering the correct 'PASSWORD'.

Thank you!
